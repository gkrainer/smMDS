Welcome to the GitHub repository associated with our research on single-molecule microfluidic diffusional sizing (smMDS), as detailed in Krainer et al. 2023 BioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.12.548675). This repository hosts two distinct scripts for analysis of smMDS experiments: the first script (see folder 'SingleMoleculeAnalysis') is dedicated to the analysis of single-molecule events from step scan measurements by counting the number of bursts, or single molecules, as they pass through the confocal spot. This code was written by Raphael Jacquat. The second script (see folder 'DiffusionProfileAnalysis') utilizes the data gathered by the first to calculate the hydrodynamic radius of the particles under observation. This code is adapted from code originally written by Quentin Peter. For the most recent updates, please visit the GitHub repository: https://github.com/impact27/diffusion_device. This README guide will assist you in setting up the necessary software environment and provides a tutorial with an example demo dataset (see folder 'Example') for using these scripts to analyze .ptu files for diffusional sizing in microfluidic chips. Expected results for the analysis of the example demo dataset can be found in the folder 'Example/ExpectedResults'. The codes here are published under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3, 29 June 2007.

# Installation instructions

This code package is compatible with Python 3.6. We recommend ensuring that your system runs this version for optimal performance. While later versions up to currently used (Python 3.11) should also function, their compatibility is not guaranteed. For users needing to install Python, Anaconda is our suggested platform for its ease of use and comprehensive package management. The commands given below should be written in the Anaconda prompt application or any terminal which accept pip.

The burst detection script (in folder 'SingleMoleculeAnalysis') is designed to run independently, requiring no additional installation process. The code for diffusion profile analysis (in folder 'DiffusionProfileAnalysis') requires an installation process (see Section 'Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation of dependency', 'Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation' and 'Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation check'). This code is designed to be flexible, capable of working with data profiles obtained from confocal microscopy or extracting such profiles directly from images. It incorporates several dependencies, such as opencv3, which, while not directly utilized for the experiments described in our paper, are necessary for the code's full functionality.

## Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation of dependency
First, install opencv3 and tifffile with pip OR conda (if you use the recommended Anaconda platform):

Installation with pip:
- `pip install tifffile`
- `pip install opencv-python`

Installation with conda:
- `conda install -c menpo opencv3`
- `conda install -c conda-forge tifffile`

You should now be able to import the following from python:
- `import cv2`
- `import tifffile`

If your operating system is Windows and cv2 does not install with the import prompt, you might need to download the wheel yourself:
- https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv

You can then install the package with pip:
- `pip install opencv_python‑3.3.1‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl`

## Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation
From the Anaconda prompt or the terminal where pip works, move into the folder 'DiffusionProfileAnalysis':

In Windows/UNIX environment:
- `cd DiffusionProfileAnalysis`

Then use pip to install the package:
- `pip install .`

This will install the code for diffusion profile analysis.

## Code DiffusionProfileAnalysis - Installation check
Open the 'DiffusionProfileAnalysis/Samples' folder and run in that order:
`generate_metadata.py`
`generate_settings.py`
`sizescript.py`
If everything is running fine, you can proceed with analysis. Notably, the 'DiffusionProfileAnalysis' folder is no longer required for analysis.

# Tutorial: Extracting the hydrodynamic radius from smMDS measurements
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to extract the hydrodynamic radius from smMDS measurements. The process is divided into two main steps:

1.-Extracting diffusion profiles from recorded time traces:
The first step involves processing the recorded time traces at each position to identify single-molecule events using a burst-search algorithm. This analysis is conducted with the code in the "SingleMoleculeAnalysis" folder, which requires data in .ptu format. After identifying these events, the code creates diffusion profiles by plotting the number of counted molecules as a function of chip position.

2.-Analyzing diffusion profiles to obtain the hydrodynamic radius:
Following the generation of diffusion profiles, the next step is to employ the previously installed diffusional sizing code to analyze these profiles. This analysis will enable you to extract the hydrodynamic radius.

This tutorial uses an example demo dataset which can be found in the folder 'Example', featuring an smMDS measurement of labeled human serum albumin (HSA) at a concentration of 20 pM in PBS buffer, supplemented with 0.01% Tween20. The measurement utilized a flow rate of 100 µL/h, scanning 400 steps, each for 2 seconds. The diffusion profile of this example demo dataset is shown in the paper in Figure 2c (top panel).

## Extracting diffusion profiles from recorded time traces
Execute the script 'getBursts_severalfiles_extractprofilesMDS.py' located within the folder 'SingleMoleculeAnalysis'. This script takes all .ptu files from a subfolder and creates diffusion profiles from smMDS measurements. Upon executing the script, a Tkinter window will appear (often hidden in the background), prompting you to select a .ptu file from your subfolder. The script will select every .ptu files from that folder to extract the number of counted molecule per position (meaning per .ptu file). You can try this using the data provided in the example demo dataset by navigating to the subfolder 'Example/HSA_20pM_PBS_0p01tween_100ulph_400steps_2sec_27'. Execute the script, choose any .ptu file, and wait for the analysis to finish. The code extract not only the number of bursts but also several other parameters at each scan step. These include the minimum, maximum, and median intensities (photon counts) of detected bursts, the scan position, and the total intensity (SumPhoton). Everything is extracted in an output folder within the selected file folder. Alldata.txt concatenate all the extracted parameters. Expected results for the analysis of the example demo dataset can be found in the folder 'Example/ExpectedResults/SingleMoleculeAnalysis'.

###Customization and changing parameters

You can modify burst analysis parameters in the 'getBursts_severalfiles_extractprofilesMDS.py' script by navigating to the 'Parameters' section. Key parameters include 'set_lee_filter', 'threshold_iT_signal', 'min_phs_burst', 'filter_name' and 'output_folder'. Except for 'output_folder' — which specifies the save location for extracted data — all parameters are elaborated in the Supplementary Information of the associated paper. Parameters named with 'noise' are currently inactive, intended for future updates to distinguish between noise and molecules automatically. The 'show_plot' option, set to 'True', enables viewing of intermediate plots, useful for debugging unusual traces, though caution is advised due to the potential generation of 400 plots in a 400-step scan. 

###Important note on data format

Ensure each .ptu file in your folder embeds position data in its name, using the format "_X.XXum_". Here, "X" ranges from 0 to 10000, and "XX" denotes two additional digits. Adhering to this naming standard is essential for the precise extraction and analysis of your data.

## Running Diffusional Sizing
Following the extraction of diffusion profiles from time traces, advance to the diffusional sizing analysis. This necessitates two metadata files, generated by 'generate_metadata.py' and 'generate_settings.py', found in the 'Example' folder. Execute these scripts before running 'sizescript.py' to determine the hydrodynamic radius from the profiles. Sizing outcomes are in the folder 'Example/Output_results/settings/output/', featuring 'Alldata_fig.pdf' which displays the calculated sizes. This can be tested on the example demo dataset. Expected results for the analysis of the example demo dataset can be found in the folder 'Example/ExpectedResults/DiffusionProfileAnalysis'. The expected hydrodynamic radius for this measurement is 3.69 nm [3.51; 3.88]nm.

###Customization and changing parameters

1. Generating metadata with generate_metadata.py

'generate_metadata.py' is designed to define the structure and experimental conditions of your dataset for analysis. It requires information such as the data path, type, chip characteristics, and experimental characteristic (flowrate and sample used). Use 'multi_pos_scan' if your data combines four profiles in a single file; otherwise, opt for 'single_pos_scan' for datasets with one peak profile per file. The script also gathers details on microfluidic chip characteristics like channel height, wall width, number of channels, flow rate, and the positions traversed between profiles. Additionally, it defines the pixel size, indicating the distance between scan positions.

3. Generating settings with generate_setting.py

'generate_setting.py' focuses on the analytical settings for the fitting process, including the radius range to test, the spacing between tested radii (either linear or logarithmic), and whether to filter or pre-bin profiles for more efficient fitting. Normally, processing 400 points takes under a minute, but increasing the number of points per profile set can significantly impact the computation time going easily further 10 min to an hour.

4. Configuring sizescript.py

To run sizescript.py, specify three inputs: the paths to the metadata files generated by 'generate_metadata.py' and 'generate_settings.py', and the path to the output folder. This script integrates the provided information to perform the diffusional sizing analysis.
